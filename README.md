# Spam Detector Capstone Project

This repository contains a comprehensive spam detection system consisting of a Flask web application and a Chrome browser extension. This project provides users with multiple ways to identify spam content using the Naive Bayes model.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two main components in separate folders:

- **Flask Web Application**: A standalone web interface for spam detection
- **Chrome Extension**: A browser extension that integrates spam detection directly into your browser

## Features

- Real-time spam detection
- User-friendly web interface
- Chrome extension for seamless integration
- Local deployment

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Google Chrome browser
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Navigate to the project root directory and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Flask, flask-cors, numpy, and other necessary dependencies.

## Running the Flask Web Application

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Open the `spam_app` folder in VS Code
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal → New Terminal)
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. The terminal will display a localhost URL
6. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided localhost URL
7. The spam detection web interface should now be accessible

## Running the Chrome Extension

### Setting Up the Extension Backend

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Open the `spam_extension` folder in VS Code
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code
4. Run the Flask backend for the extension:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Keep this terminal running in the background

### Installing the Chrome Extension

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your address bar
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Browse to and select the `spam_extension` folder from this repository
6. The extension should now appear in your Chrome extensions bar
7. You can now use the extension while browsing

## Usage

### Web Application
- Navigate to the Flask app URL
- Enter text content you want to check
- Receive spam classification results

### Chrome Extension
- Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
- Use the interface to analyze content on the current page or input custom text
- View spam detection results directly in your browser

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: If you see an error about the port being in use, modify the port number in `app.py`
- **Module not found errors**: Verify all required Python packages are installed using pip
